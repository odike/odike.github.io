                        <h2>Background</h2>
                        <p class="ptext">I was raised in Lagos, Nigeria and attended high school at Loyola Jesuit College in Gidan Mangoro, Abuja. Prior to college in Illinois, I had no experience with programming but I was very intrigued by computers and technology in general. I fell in love with programming while taking my first Java class in college and decided to pursue a career in the field.</p>

                    <div class="career">
                        <h2>Career</h2>
                        <p class="ptext">My most recent and most rewarding role thus far has been my Software Engineering role at Dell Technologies in Round Rock, TX. I had the opportunity to build critical and highly scalable features to power billing & payment processing in an internal sales application. Prior to that, I worked as an intern at Marathon Petroleum Corporation working predominantly with databases, writing queries to analyze data and improving efficiency of various database environments. I have also had the honor of teaching object-oriented programming concepts to undergraduate students at the Illinois Institute of Technology.</p>

                        <h2>Interests</h2>
                        <p class="ptext">I am always listening to some kind of music so itâ€™s safe to say that I am a music enthusiast. I also love sports, especially football (not American football) and am a huge supporter of Manchester United. With regards to Computer Science and programming in general, I am very interested in artificial intelligence, specifically machine learning and I plan to focus on that in my graduate degree program at New York University.</p>
